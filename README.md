## What We Did!!!

Using a Spotify API we pulled 5 Categories
* Country 
* EDM
* Pop
* Hip Hop
* Latin

Used Jupyter Notebook to create a CSV file with all the files.

## Created a SQLite database

* Then used SQL alchemy to get into a flask app.py

## Developed Web Page

* Interactive Webpage were users can click on category of music that they want to listen to and then pick which playlist they want 

## Future Plans

* Once user clicks on playlist, playlist loads to p/c or mobile device and user can play.
